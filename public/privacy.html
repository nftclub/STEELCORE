  <h1>SteelCore Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>SteelCore is an offline-first personal training load tracker. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how the app handles your data.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>SteelCore does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All data you enter is stored exclusively on your device using the browser's local storage (IndexedDB).</p>
  <p>The following data is stored locally on your device only:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Workout entries (date, duration, intensity, calculated load)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or transmit any data to third parties. Your workout data never leaves your device.</p>

  <h2>Internet Access</h2>
  <p>SteelCore requires an internet connection only for the initial load of the web application. After installation, the app functions fully offline. No user data is sent over the network at any time.</p>

  <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
  <p>SteelCore does not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising tools. There are no cookies, no fingerprinting, and no third-party SDKs that collect user data.</p>

  <h2>Health Data</h2>
  <p>SteelCore displays mathematical calculations based on data you manually enter. The app does not access, read, or write to any health platforms (e.g. Google Fit, Apple Health). The app does not provide medical advice or health risk assessments.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>SteelCore is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all app data at any time by clearing the app's storage through your device settings, or by uninstalling the app.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@steelcore.app">support@steelcore.app</a></p>
